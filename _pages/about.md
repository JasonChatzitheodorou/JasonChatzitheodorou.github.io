Hello, I'm Jason! I am a PhD student in the [IEOR](https://ieor.columbia.edu/) department of [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), advised by [Eric Balkanski](https://ericbalkanski.com/). Prior to joining Columbia, I finished my undergraduate studies in the [ECE](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) department of the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) where I was advised by [Dimitris Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/).

I am generally interested in the areas of combinatorial and stochastic optimization, with a focus on beyond-worst-case analysis and decision-making under uncertainty. Some problems I am actively working on are stochastic online matching, online clustering and submodular maximization. During my undergraduate thesis I focused on algorithms with machine learning predictions.
